# Types of Learning
1. Supervised Learning (Focused)
2. Unsupervised & Self-supervised Learning
3. Transfer Learning (Focused)

# What can Deep Learning be used for?
## Use cases
1. Recommendation
2. Translation => Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)
3. Speech Recognition => Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)
4. Computer Vision => Classification/regression
5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) => Classification/regression


# What is Pytorch
- Most popular research deep learning framework
- Write fast deep learning code in Python (Able to run on a GPU/many GPUs)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub/torchvision.models)
- Whole stack: Preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud
- Originally designed and used in-house by Facebook/Meta


# This repo covers my learning progress to
- Get started with using PyTorch to build models
- Build and deploy custom trained PyTorch neural network accessible to the public
- Expand your Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills and toolkit
- Understand how to integrate Deep Learning into tools and applications
